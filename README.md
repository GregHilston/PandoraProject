==============

As there is no official API for Pandora and the unofficial API hasn't been working as expected, I'll be writing scripts to grab the data I need from Pandora.


<h4>Grab Thumbed Up Tracks</h4>
<i>Note: Tested on Google Chrome Version 36.0.1985.125 on 7/22/2014</i>

Description: If you're like me, you have many likes on Pandora. As of writing this, I have over 700 thumbed up tracks. Pandora has made it quite difficult to get access to this data. I believe they hide this, so users cannot easily take their data and go to compeitors (Spotify, youtube playlist...). Anyways, I wrote this scipt to assist users with grabbing every track that they've thumbed up. Enjoy!

How To Execute: In Google Chrome press [Ctrl + Shift + J] and in the console, copy and paste the script's source code. Make sure you replace number_of_thumbed_up_songs with the number of thumbed up songs you have and press enter. Once the script finishes, copy and paste the songs from the console output.

Problems: The script currently takes a long time and eats a lot of memory. (Took over 20 minutes and 1.3 GB of RAM)
